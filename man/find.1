.SH NAME
find \- print lines matching a pattern

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfind\fP [-i] [-n] [-v] \fIpattern\fP [\fIfiles\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfind\fP reads the given \fIfiles\fP (or standard input)
a line at a time and writes to standard output those lines
that match the specified \fIpattern\fP. If multiple files
are specified, each match is prefixed by the corresponding
file name.

A text pattern is a concatenation of the following elements:

.RS
.TP
\fIc\fP
literal character \fIc\fP
.TP
\fB.\fP
any character except newline (dot)
.TP
\fB^\fP
beginning of line
.TP
\fB$\fP
end of line (matches the null string before newline)
.TP
\fB[\fP...\fB]\fP
character class (any one of these characters)
.TP
\fB[^\fP...\fB]\fP
negated character class (all but these characters)
.TP
\fB*\fP
zero or more occurrences of previous element (closure)
.TP
\fB+\fP
one or more occurrences of previous element (closure)
.TP
\fB\\\fP\fIc\fP
escaped character (e.g., \fB\\^\fP, \fB\\[\fP, \fB\\*\fP)
.RE

Special meaning of characters in a text pattern is lost when
escaped, inside \fB[...]\fP (except \fB\\\fP), or for: \fB%\fP not
at beginning, \fB$\fP not at end, \fB*\fP at beginning of
pattern.

A character class consists of zero or more of the following
elements, surrounded by \fB[\fP and \fB]\fP:

.RS
.TP
\fIc\fP
literal character \fIc\fP, including \fB[\fP
.TP
\fIc1\fB-\fIc2\fR
range of characters (digits, lower or upper case letters)
.TP
\fB^\fP
negated character class (if at beginning)
.TP
\fB\\\fP\fIc\fP
escaped character (e.g., \fB\\^\fP, \fB\\-\fP, \fB\\\\\fP, \fB\\]\fP)
.RE

Special meaning of characters in a character class is lost
when escaped or for: \fB^\fP not at beginning, \fB-\fP at
beginning or at end.

An escape sequence consists of the character \fB\\\fP followed
by a single character: \fB\\n\fP newline, \fB\\t\fP tab,
\fB\\\fP\fIc\fP the character \fIc\fP (including \fB\\\fP).

.SS Options
.TP
\fB-i\fP
ignore case
.TP
\fB-n\fP
prefix line number in output
.TP
\fB-v\fP
emit lines that do not match the pattern

.SH EXAMPLE
