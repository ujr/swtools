From the book's blurb:

Good Programming is not learned from generalities, but by seeing
how significant programs can be made clean, easy to read, easy
to maintain and modify, human-engineered, efficient, and reliable,
by the application of common sense and good programming practices.
Careful study and imitation of good programs leads to better writing.

## About the Book

With the same style and clarity that characterized their highly
acclaimed *The Elements of Programming Style* and *Software Tools*,
the authors have written *Software Tools in Pascal* to teach how
to write good Pascal programs that make good tools. The programs
contained in the book are not artificial, but are actual tools
that have proved valuable in the production of other programs.

Structured programming and top-down design are emphasized and
applied to every program, as are principles of sound design, testing,
efficiency and portability. All of the programs are complete and have
been tested directly from the text.

*Software Tools in Pascal* is ideal for use in a software engineering
course, for a second course in programming, or as a supplement in
any programming course. All programmers, professional and student,
will find the book invaluable as a source of proven, useful programs
for reading and study. Numerous exercises are provided to test
comprehension and to extend the concepts presented in the book.
